# About
<p>Drones are quickly becoming utilized in the public sphere for entertainment, photography, surveillance, high-speed delivery, and remote healthcare. InTellogence is an open-source codebase made to supplement self-education for university students and hobbyists exploring drone control topics, using the low-cost DJI Tello Edu. It integrates multi-drone centralized control, computer vision, functional safety, and a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI). All code is written in Python, powered by popular packages such as OpenCV, FLET, and NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA. InTellogence ultimately lowers the barrier of entry to drone robotics through detailed documentation and easily modified design . 
## Purpose
We hope that students or people enthusiastic about learning about drones are able to gain new knowledge through this repository and possibly contribute to it.</p>

TODO Add hub and spoke

## Features
inTellogence has the following features:
- Ability to control 1 or 2 drones through a router
- Use of Tello Mission Pads to confine the drone to a space
- Finite state machine that uses <a href = https://youtu.be/umkyPWDrys4>potential fields navigation</a>
- Additional safety measures using industry functional safety techniques
- Integrates <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics"> Ultralytics Yolov8</a> for object recognition
- Ability to quickly implement and layer reactive behaviors to objects and sensor readings
- [Flet](https://flet.dev)-powered language-agnostic GUI (Python, Go, C#)
- Easy-to-understand & User-tested documentation

## System Components
<details>
<summary>Graphic User Interface (GUI)</summary>
<br>
inTellogence uses <a href="https://flet.dev">Flet</a>, a simplified <a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a> model, to build the GUI. Python is currently supported, but Go and C# are <a href="https://flet.dev/roadmap/">coming soon</a>.<br>
<br> 

When first starting the program, the GUI brings you to a connection setup page where a user will be able to connect 1 or 2 drones. <br> 
<br> 

TODO Connection Page Image

After verifying that the drone(s) are connected, the user can continue to a Main Dashboard that displays the OpenCV window output, text input for chosen object identification, and buttons to Launch, Land, Hover an inidividual drone or both drones simultaneosly. <br> 
<br> 
<img src="imgs/drone_screenshot.PNG" width="500">
<br>

The GUI uses the following components<br>

<summary><b>Multi-threading</b></summary>
<br>
We use threading to allow the GUI to access drone functions while the drone flight algorithm is running. This becomes a problem if the threads try to read/write the same piece of memory at the exact same time, but the chances of this happening are low for this project.<br><br>

<summary><b>OpenCV window for Flet</b></summary>
<br>
The code from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58aPh8rKKsk">Azu Technology</a> that creates a modern GUI for an OpenCV window was modified to display the OpenCV Tello video stream through the GUI. This repository is one of few, if not the only, that allows the Tello streaming window to be viewed through Flet.<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Finite State Machine</summary>
<br>
General control of both drones is organized around a Finite State Machine (FSM). The primary state of wander is implemented alongside a few states that support smooth and safe operation. The general control logic is shown below.
<br> 

<img src="imgs/control_loop.png" width="1000">
</details> 

<details>
<summary>Reactive Control Through Potential Fields</summary>
<br>
The primary path planning approach for Sky Guardian lies in <a href = https://youtu.be/umkyPWDrys4>reactive control through potential fields</a>. In order to allow the drones to wander in a constrained space, Tello mission pads are utitilized in a pre-defined map. These mission pads allow the drone to localize and respond appropriately when moving out of intended airspace, applying a movement force proportional to it's measured distance outside of desired airspace. If you're interested in some of the math behind this, check out Coordinate Modelling in Supplemental Documentation

<br> 
<img src="imgs/boundary_force.png" width="300">

<br> 

TODO add more links throughout here.
Sky Guardian provides an outline for implementing various reactions to certain stimuli. For our purposes, reactions are individual responses to certain stimuli (ie, the drone detects a banana) and behaviors are sets of those reactions. We have defined two types of reactions: blocking and movement. <br>

A blocking reaction initiates a pre-defined set of instructions, during which the drone is incapable of performing any other movements. The stimuli trigger blocks the continuation of the control loop for a time. <br>

A movement reaction defines non-blocking instructions. So, it returns a movement force according to the same idea as potential fields. Hence, a drone could tend to fly toward certain objects or away from others. <br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary>Object Recognition using Yolov8</summary>
<br>

Sky Guardian performs object recognition by implementing <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics"> Ultralytics Yolov8 </a>. All video feed analysis is abstracted out into the VideoAnalyzer class from <i>video_analyzer.py</i>. This wrapper class adds the ability to automatically download all Object Recognition models, as well as adjust the model size (speed/accuracy tradeoff), and acceptable confidence level. To explore the other models available using Yolov8 (pose, image segmentation, etc), consider editing <i>video_analyzer.py</i>.<br>

The output of the network can be slightly confusing (this article was helpful determining syntax <a href=""> here</a>.)
To access results in the form of an Nx6 matrix, use syntax along the lines of results[0].boxes.boxes The indexes are shown below: <br>

0: x1 bounding box coordinate<br>
1: y1 boudning box coordinate<br>
2: x2 bounding box coordinate<br>
3: y2 bounding box coordinate<br>
4: confidence score<br>
5 class label<br>

In order to speed up this detection process, this repository assumes the use of CUDA 11.8. This offloads the inference calculations to the GPU, which it can be parallelized. Installation instructions can be found in Getting Started. Yolov8 allows for very minimal setup in this respect.<br>

<summary>Functional Safety Engineering</summary>
<br>
<p><a href="https://www.61508.org/knowledge/what-is-a-functional-safety-system.php">Functional Safety Engineering</a> provides users exposure and a framework to implement various safety features that they deem necessary. Functional Safety involves developing safety-related systems for the Electronic/Electrical/Programmable Electronic components of a system. <a href="https://www.61508.org/knowledge/what-is-iec-61508.php">IEC61508</a>, <a href="https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/24241">IEC61511</a>, <a href="https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/59927">IEC62061</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html">ISO26262</a> are the standards of reference in Functional Safety Engineering.</p>

<p>Safety-Related Systems usually comprise of a sensor that provides information, a processor that provides logic to react to sensor readings, and an actuator or system component provides output based on this logic. These are the types of systems that are studied to identify potential risks and then deliver an appropriate solution that provides the appropriate level of risk reduction, protection, or mitigation.</p>

<p>In this project, our system is the Tello drone which relies on its camera, IMU, barometer, temperature sensor, and battery charge sensor to pull in information.  We have developed safety systems that attempt to mitigate risks when encountering stationary obstacles(like a wall) or moving obstacles(like a human). Some example safety features include: </p>
<li> Monitoring the battery temperature to check if it is overheating in flight and landing the drone if it does overheat. This helps preserve battery life.</li>
<li> Checking to see if the drone is oriented properly before takeoff to ensure that it does not launch into a trajectory that could cause it to hit something.</li>
<li> Using computer vision to detect objects, classify them, and take appropriate actions depending on the object classification. </li> 
<li> Using mission pads to localize and properly constrain the flight environment that the Tello drones use to navigate. </li> 
</p>

<p>Functional Safety Engineering uses the <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26262:-9:ed-1:v1:en">V-model development process</a> from the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html">ISO26262</a> standard, which is shown below. <br><br>


<img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/iso-26262/v-model-iso-26262.png" width="500">
<em>The left side of the V-model is conceptual development and product development. The bottom of the V-model is where the hardware and software designs are implemented. The right side of the V-model is where all testing activities of the design happen. </em>


</p>
<p>Safety Features are designed during conceptual development in a process called the â€˜<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06140.pdf">Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment</a>â€™ or HARA. HARA uses an <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/what-is-asil.html">ASIL risk rating</a> chart to properly classify the specific HARA line item in question. Collisions in this project receive a SIL1 rating based off initial severity (S1), initial exposure (E3), and initial avoidability (C2). More information on the HARA can be found in the supplemental documentation. </p>

Once these safety features are implemented properly either through hardware or software measures, they are then testing as single units, in integration testing, and regression testing to ensure that everything works properly. From there, the project can be deployed with assurance that there are safety features present to actively mitigate risks.

<summary>Networking</summary>

<br>
Two different approaches to swarm control are centralized and decentralized control. 

In decentralized control, each drone has a unique "brain" and makes decisions on its own, with limited information from other actors in the swarm.

In centralized control, computation is done from a centralized controller, that then sends commands to individual actors to follow through. 

This project utilized a centralized control structure with communication over Wi-Fi, through a router, as seen below.

</details> 

# Getting Started
We used the following materials for this project:
- 2 Tello EDU drones
- Router (we used the <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC1750-Smart-WiFi-Router/dp/B079JD7F7G/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=WiFi%2BRouters%2Bfor%2BHome&qid=1663443788&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc&th=1">TP-Link AC1750 Smart WiFi Router (Archer A7)</a>
- 16 Tello Mission Pads (a printable version is in ref, but originally from <a href="https://tellopilots.com/threads/download-official-ryze-tello-edu-mission-pads.2756/">here</a>)

## Router and Drone Connection
This section will cover how to set up the router, connect your computer to it, and connect the drones to it.

1. Connect router to power source and turn on.
2. Disconnect from the wifi you are connected to. 
3. Connect to the router.
4. Find the non 5G SSID and click connect.
5. Locate the password to the router located on the bottom of the router. This should also include the specific router name.
6. Download the program "Packet Sender".
7. Turn on one of the Tello Edu Drones by clicking on the side power button.
8. Connect the wifi to the tello edu drone.
9. In Packet Sender, in the Name field type "command".
10. In Packet Sender, in the ASCII field type "command".
11. In Packet Sender, in the Address field type "192.168.10.1" and in the Port field type "8889".
12. In Packet sender, click the "Send" button. The response should be a "ok" in the logs at the bottom.
13. In Packet Sender, in the Name field type "configure ap".
14. In Packet Sender, in the ASCII field type "ap ROUTER_NAME ROUTER_PASSWORD".
15. Click the "Send" button. The response should be "Ok, drone will reboot in 3s".
16. Repeat steps 8-15 for the other drones you would like to link up with the router.
17. Turn off all drones. 
18. Connect to the router. Type "espn.com" and fill in the login information displayed.
19. Navigate to the DHCP section in the website.
20. Turn on one of the drones and a new IP address should appear in the DHCP section. Record the IP address shown in the DHCP section.
21. Repeat step 20 for all of the drones but ensure that only one drone is active at a time.
22. Now all drones(have a recorded IP address) and add these drone IPs in the code.

## Necessary Installations

### Verify that your GPU is supported by CUDA
First, verify that your system is GPU capable. Open your Device Manager and scroll to "Display Adapters." If your system has one, the GPU will be listed here. To ensure that your system is CUDA capable, make sure your GPU is one listed as supported here <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">here</a>.<br><br>

<img src="imgs/gpu_capable.png" width="500">
<em>Here, we can see our GPU is the Nvidia Quadro P1000</em><br><br>

### Download and install Cuda (11.8)
Once you know things your system is compatible, the version we used can be found <a href=https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive>here</a>. Make sure to use 11.8. Installation is as easy as downloading and installing with all defaults!


### Environment Setup

This tutorial assumes you are using the environment manager <a href= "https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>. See Supplemental Documentation if you are unfamiliar with Anaconda, as it's an incredibly helpful tool for navigating python distributions.
<br></br>
There are multiple options to install required packages.
<br></br>

<details> <summary> Anaconda Navigator </summary>

Using from the environments page in Anaconda Navigator, simply import the inTellogence_environment.yaml file.
</details>

<details> <summary> Anaconda Prompt </summary>

With your desired environment activated, and the inTellogence folder active, run the following command:

```conda env create -f drone.yaml```

</details>

<details><summary>Without Anaconda</summary>
A requirements file is included for convenience. Install through the following command in your virtual environment:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
</details>

<br>

## Mission Pad Setup
For inTellogence to work as expected, it's important to setup the mission pads as the drone expects to see them, as mapping is currently not supported. This layout is shown below, where orientation, spacing and layout are important. Should you wish to adjust the spacing between the pads, these are defined as global constants in MissionPadMap found in <i>sensory_state.py</i>, set by default to 50cm center to center. Since Tello EDU currently only supports 8 different mission pads, the flyable space is separated into two sectors, in which the drones track which quadrant they are in.

IMPORTANT: When taking off, place the drones facing the X direction and in Sector 1

# Running the Code

# Examples
<details><summary> Create a new behavior/reaction</summary>
<br>
There are two different types of reactions: movement and blocking. Let's create a new movement reaction, which will return a force vector to the drone. Open <i>reaction.py</i>.
<br></br>
These reactions have access to all the sensory information from the drone via the input argument.
<br></br>
First extend the movementReaction class:

```python
class moveBackIfPerson(movementReaction):
```

Now lets add an identifier so the GUI can read it:

```python
identifier = "Move back if person"`
```

Define the reaction:

```python
def react(self,input: SensoryState, currentMovement: np.array):
  res = np.zeros((4,1)) #base column array to return the force vector
  if input.visibleObjects is not None: # don't iterate through something not there!
    for object in input.visibleObjects:
      if(int(object[5]) == int(vision_class.person)):
        res[1] = 5 # move the drone back

  return res
  #Note that additional information about the structure of "visible Objects" can be found above in "Object Recognition using Yolov8"

```
Almost there! Now open <i>behavior.py</i>.

Create a new behavior (set of reactions)

```python
class myNewBehavior(behaviorFramework):
  # lets not add any blocking reactions
  blockingReactions = [] 
  # Lets add a previously made reaction with our new one!
  movementReactions = [rxt.followCellPhone(),rxt.moveBackIfPerson()]
```

This behavior is what you will pass in when you create your drone object!

</details>

<details><summary> Add a new button to the GUI<summary>

</details>

<details><summary> Add a custom State </summary>
Adding a new state is simple!

In <i>drone_states.py</i>, just add the name of your new state, we'll call ours "Dance", with an arbitary, unique number:

```python
class State(Enum):
    Grounded = 1
    Takeoff = 2
    Land = 3
    Wander = 4
    #new state
    Dance = 5
```

Now, in <i>drone.py</i>, find the operate function. In it is a match-case block that changes the drone's actions based on the state. Let's add a new case:

```python
  case State.Land:
    ...
  case State.Dance:
    self.dance(): 
    if (conditional):
      self.opState = State.NextState #pseudocode
```
Here, dance() could be whatever you want. Just make sure the function isn't blocking!

[Coordinate Modelling](Ref/Coordinate_Modelling.pdf)

<details><summary>Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment</summary>

The HARA consists of the following steps:
<details><summary><b>Assumptions</b></summary>

<br>
Assumptions are created on how terminology is used and about the environment the product is in.
<br> <br>
<p>For this project, an example assumption is that the primary obstacles to be avoided will be stationary furniture and walls along with the users of the drones in the testing room.
<br>
</details> 

<details><summary><b>Existing External Mitigating Measures</b></summary>

<br>
These are risk reducing factors that are already present in an environment. They exist independently of the systems.
<br>
For this project, to prevent the drone from hitting people, the only person(s) that can be present in the testing room are the drone operators. This mitigating measure is not in any drone control systems.<br><br>
</details> 

<details><summary><b>Operational Situations</b></summary>

<br>
These are the scenarios that the designers expect their product to be in regularly while it is operation/active/or in use. The designers will come up with â€˜Considered Situational Attributesâ€™ which are guide words that describe â€˜motionâ€™, â€˜modeâ€™, â€˜obstacle exposureâ€™, and â€˜controlâ€™.
</details> 

<details><summary><b>Guide words</b></summary>

<br>
In Functional Safety, guide words are created to produce operational scenarios. For this project some of our guide words were as follows: Mode = Launched, Motion = Forward, Control = Independent (not in swarm configuration), Obstacle Exposure = â€˜Staticâ€™.An example operational scenario is â€˜a single independent drone is launched and in a forward motion surveying a space with static objects.â€™
</details> 

<details>
<summary><b>Hazard List</b></summary>

<br>
List of potential hazards and their type pulled from a list in the ISO12100 standard. Relevant Mechanical Hazards for the project include:
- Impact due to collision with stationary object
- Impact due to collision with moving object
---
</details> 

<details>
<summary><b>Hazardous Operation</b></summary>

<br>
Hazerdous Operation combines Tasks and Functions along with suggested guidewords pulled from the SAEJ2980 standard to create potential resulting malfunctions. The resulting malfunctions constitute Hazardous Operation.
In this project, when the â€˜Automated drone(s) is exploringâ€™ an environment â€˜as intendedâ€™, there is hazard exposure do to obstacles that are present in the environment. The resulting malfunction is an errant flight path if a collision occurs.
---
</details> 

<details>
<summary><b>Hazardous Events</b></summary>

<br>
Hazerdous events combines Hazardous Operation and Operational Situation to describe the Hazardous Event that needs to be mitigated. 
In this project when the â€˜Automated drone(s) is exploringâ€™ an environment â€˜as intendedâ€™, and there is hazard exposure do to obstacles that are present in the environment while â€˜a single independent drone is launched and in a forward motion surveying a space with static objectsâ€™, the hazardous event is that the drone or operator is at risk of being hit by the drone should a malfunction occur because of the collision. 
---
</details> 

<details><summary><b>Risk Reduction Measure</b></summary>

<br>
These are the safety features, which could either be design based or policy/procedural based, that are implemented to reduce the HARA line item to a lower risk rating per the ASIL risk rating chart.
For this project, we utilized computer vision and coded responses that react based on the type of object seen, as the basis for collision-based Risk Reduction Measures that lowered our SIL1 rating down to SIL0.
